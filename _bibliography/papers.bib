Prior work has investigated the suitability of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to find the ground state of these models.

Here, by focusing on the Lipkin and Agassi models, we investigate how to do this in the context of nuclear physics ground state problems.

@article{weijie2025fundamentalaspects,
	abstract = {Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) have emerged as a promising framework for quantum machine learning. Their appeal lies in the rich feature map induced by the dynamics of a quantum substrate---the quantum reservoir---and the efficient post-measurement training via linear regression. Here, we study the expressivity of QELMs by decomposing the prediction of QELMs into a Fourier series. We show that the achievable Fourier frequencies are determined by the data encoding scheme, while Fourier coefficients depend on both the reservoir and the measurement. Notably, the expressivity of QELMs is fundamentally limited by the number of Fourier frequencies and the number of observables, while the complexity of the prediction hinges on the reservoir. As a cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the exponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows (randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show how this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles. In particular, our result on the reservoir-induced concentration strongly indicates that quantum reservoirs drawn from a highly random ensemble make QELM models unscalable. Our analysis elucidates the potential and fundamental limitations of QELMs and lays the groundwork for systematically exploring quantum reservoir systems for other machine learning tasks.},

@article{rudolph2024trainabilitybarriers,
	abstract = {Quantum generative models provide inherently efficient sampling strategies and thus show promise for achieving an advantage using quantum hardware. In this work, we investigate the barriers to the trainability of quantum generative models posed by barren plateaus and exponential loss concentration. We explore the interplay between explicit and implicit models and losses, and show that using quantum generative models with explicit losses such as the KL divergence leads to a new flavor of barren plateaus. In contrast, the implicit Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss can be viewed as the expectation value of an observable that is either low-bodied and provably trainable, or global and untrainable depending on the choice of kernel. In parallel, we find that solely low-bodied implicit losses cannot in general distinguish high-order correlations in the target data, while some quantum loss estimation strategies can. We validate our findings by comparing different loss functions for modeling data from High-Energy-Physics.},

@article{eckstein2024largescalesimulations,
	abstract = {Periodically driven quantum systems exhibit a diverse set of phenomena but are more challenging to simulate than their equilibrium counterparts. Here, we introduce the Quantum High-Frequency Floquet Simulation (QHiFFS) algorithm as a method to simulate fast-driven quantum systems on quantum hardware. Central to QHiFFS is the concept of a kick operator which transforms the system into a basis where the dynamics is governed by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. This allows prior methods for time-independent simulation to be lifted to simulate Floquet systems. We use the periodically driven biaxial next-nearest neighbor Ising (BNNNI) model, a natural test bed for quantum frustrated magnetism and criticality, as a case study to illustrate our algorithm. We implemented a 20-qubit simulation of the driven two-dimensional BNNNI model on Quantinuum's trapped ion quantum computer. Our error analysis shows that QHiFFS exhibits not only a cubic advantage in driving frequency ωbut also a linear advantage in simulation time t compared to Trotterization.},

@article{thanasilp2024exponentialconcentration,
	abstract = {Kernel methods in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) have recently gained significant attention as a potential candidate for achieving a quantum advantage in data analysis. Among other attractive properties, when training a kernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due to the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the assumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from quantum hardware. In this work we study the performance of quantum kernel models from the perspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We show that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different input data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards some fixed value. Thus on training with a polynomial number of measurements, one ends up with a trivial model where the predictions on unseen inputs are independent of the input data. We identify four sources that can lead to concentration including expressivity of data embedding, global measurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated concentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived. Lastly, we show that when dealing with classical data, training a parametrized data embedding with a kernel alignment method is also susceptible to exponential concentration. Our results are verified through numerical simulations for several QML tasks. Altogether, we provide guidelines indicating that certain features should be avoided to ensure the efficient evaluation of quantum kernels and so the performance of quantum kernel methods.},
