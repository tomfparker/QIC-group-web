### Armando Angrisani (Post Doc)

Armando is from Cava de' Tirreni, Italy, described as a Mediterranean "Swiss valley" by the eloquent Paul Val√©ry. He studied Physics and Computer Science at Sapienza University. Unable to pick between the two, he pursued a PhD in Quantum Computing at Sorbonne University. After living in Rome and Paris, Armando traded the chaos of urban jungles for the tranquillity of Lake Leman. In his free time, he finds joy in cinematic escapes and in comic books. He also enjoys working out and recently took up bouldering
