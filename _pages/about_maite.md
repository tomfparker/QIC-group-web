### Maite Arcos Enriquez (Post Doc)

Maite is originally from Mexico City but moved to London, where she picked up a BSc, an MSc, and a vitamin D deficiency at King’s College London. She then crossed the road to UCL for a PhD in quantum information. In a move that would make any advisor raise an eyebrow, she ended up working on resource theories while juggling an eclectic mix of topics including thermodynamics, gambling, string theory and Hamiltonian simulation. These days she’s traded London drizzle for the shores of Lake Geneva and the Alps, and is slowly getting used to a life structured around cheese and chocolate. Outside of work, Maite does ballet, goes swimming in the lake in Lausanne whenever she gets the chance, and decompresses by playing Overcooked on her pink Nintendo Switch—ideally without setting the virtual kitchen on fire.
