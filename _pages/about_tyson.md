### Tyson (Post Doc)

Tyson is from Earth's greatest city - Melbourne, Australia -  where he indecisively completed a triple major in physics, applied mathematics and computational science. His research history is as broad as his attention span is short and includes the study of quantum computers, machine learning, probability theory, gravitational waves, high-performance computing, and quantum turbulence between universities in Melbourne, Prato, San Diego, Boston, Osaka, London, Canberra, and Oxford. These cities are sorted by decreasing liveability. Tyson completed his PhD in Oxford's QTechTheory group studying applications of near-future quantum computers, and techniques to classically emulate them. He currently clumsily juggles postdoctoral and visiting positions between the University of Oxford, Osaka University, EPFL, the UKRI NQCC and Quantum Motion Technologies. When not accumulating unmitigable burnout, Tyson enjoys playing music, writing poetry, pretending to understand the ramblings of German existentialists, and spurring the collapse of late-stage corporatism.
