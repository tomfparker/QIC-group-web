### Tyson Jones (Former Post Doc, now at NVIDIA)

Tyson is from Earth's greatest city - Melbourne -  where he indecisively completed a triple major in physics, applied mathematics and computational science. His research history is as broad as his attention span is short and includes the study of quantum computers, machine learning, probability theory, gravitational waves, high-performance computing, and quantum turbulence. Tyson completed his PhD in Oxford's QTechTheory group studying applications of near-future quantum computers, and techniques to classically emulate them. After his postdoc in QIC, Tyson joined NVIDIA's cuQuantum team developing multi-GPU simulations of quantum processes.
