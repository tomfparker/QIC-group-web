### Yanting Teng (Post Doc)

Yanting (a.k.a. Yan) is a condensed matter physicist trying to muddle in in the puddles of quantum simulation/computation. Being in a superposition of enthusiast and skeptic of quantum computing, she is excited about finding out the boundaries of classical vs quantum simulations. In particular, she spend decent time writing numerical codes and learning how to write legit proofs. She is also excited about improving the current states of noisy qubits using machine learning methods.
Beyond getting used to the nurturing research environment at the QIC group, she is usually summoned by the rocks, and soon by ice and snow. She has had the most pleasant surprise of looking at the Matterhorn on rollerblades.
