### Marc Sanz Drudis (Affiliated PhD Student)

Marc is also Catalan, did his BSc at EPFL and then moved to Zurich to do his MSc at ETH. He could not decide whether he preferred Zurich or Lausanne, so he fell somewhere in between. Doing a Ph.D. in EPFL but based in IBM Zurich. Still deep down, we all know that as long as he can play on Qiskit he will be happy (but donâ€™t dare to call him the numerics guy or he will be very upset). If he was not doing a Ph.D. he says he would be a windsurf teacher or a photographer living in a campervan.
