### Joe Gibbs (Affiliated PhD Student)

Joe graduated from the University of Warwick in 2020 after studying Maths and Physics. Quantum algorithms became a passion during a summer working with Zoe and the LANL NISQ group, developing algorithms for dynamically simulating quantum systems. He is currently a PhD student in the University of Surrey’s nuclear theory group, studying quantum algorithms for simulating many-body systems, and continues to work with Zoe and her group. When he’s not frowning at Jupyter notebooks, he enjoys running, strength training, bouldering, and listening to loud electronic music.
