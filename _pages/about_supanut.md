### Supanut Thanasilp (Former Post Doc, now Prof. at Chulalongkorn University)

Supanut was born in Thailand and has a seemingly infinite supply of Thai snacks. He graduated with a M.Sc. in Physics from Imperial College London, and then got his Ph.D. from CQT in Singapore. Being a theoretical mastermind, he is currently involved in every ongoing project at the QIC lab, is ready to help with every problem or question, and generally acts as the emotional support PostDoc of the group. Here in Switzerland, Supanut enjoys long walks on the weekends, eats more fondue than the average Swiss person and has developed a borderline worrying caffeine dependence in the form of Club Mate.
After his postdoc in QIC, Supanut joined Chulalongkorn University as a professor.
