### Hela Mhiri (Affiliated PhD Student)

Hela is from Sfax, a coastal city in Tunisia which explains her fondness for olive oil. She got her engineering diploma in 2025 from EnstaParis with a major in applied mathematics (weird french system of grandes écoles). She is currently a PhD student at Sorbonne university under the joint supervision of Prof.Elham Kashefi and Prof.Zoë Holmes, working on variational quantum algorithms and quantum learning. She is drawn to answering theoretical questions by engaging in messy calculations. She finds beauty in contrived mathematical proofs, long walks with philosophical discussions and dancing - especially during late office hours when nobody's looking.
