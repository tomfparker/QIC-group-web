### Zoë Holmes (Assistant Professor of Physics)

Zoë comes from London, studied Physics and Philosophy at Oxford, did her PhD at Imperial before escaping to the New Mexico desert for a post doc at LANL. She started the QIC group at EPFL in September 2022. She loves (perhaps too much) a good conceptual argument and thinks the prettiest calculations are ones that (once you figure out how to do them) are surprisingly simple. When she's not doing physics, she's usually found climbing, or climbing, or climbing, or maybe eating good food/dancing.
