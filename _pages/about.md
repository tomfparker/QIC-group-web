### open positions

**Two Post Doc positions** are available in the QIC group at EPFL. 

Position 1: This position will be focused broadly on analysing the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry joint with Roche. 2 year position, immediate start possible but somewhat flexible.

Position 2: This position is joint with Christa Zoufal and Stefan Woerner at IBM Quantum with a focus broadly on error analysis and algorithm development for real and imaginary time quantum evolution. 3 year position, immediate start possible but flexible.

Rolling deadline
