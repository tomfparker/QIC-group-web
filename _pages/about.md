Welcome to the Quantum Information and Computing (QIC) group at EPFL! We aim to better understand and harness the power of near-term quantum computers to solve scientific problems. We're interested in quantum machine learning, as well as exploring application of quantum computers for probelms in material science, quantum chemistry and high energy physics.

We're based at the physics department of EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.
