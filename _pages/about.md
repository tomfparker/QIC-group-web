Welcome to the Quantum Information and Computing (QIC) group at EPFL! We aim to better understand and harness the power of near-term quantum computers to solve scientific problems. We're interested in quantum machine learning, as well as exploring application of quantum computers for probelms in material science, quantum chemistry and high energy physics.

### open positions

**Two Post Doc positions** are available in Zoë Holmes's Quantum Information and Computing group at EPFL. 

Position 1: This position will be focused broadly on Quantum Learning Theory - i.e. broadly analytic work trying to understand the scalability of quantum machine learning. (2 year position, immediate start possible but somewhat flexible.) 

Position 2: This position is joint with Christa Zoufal and Stefan Woerner at IBM Quantum with a focus broadly on error analysis and algorithm development for real and imaginary time quantum evolution. (3 year position, immediate start possible but flexible.) 

Initial submission deadline Nov. 11th 2023 / until the positions are filled.

To **apply**, please follow [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScm6P163UChmDzkHN9kidxld_cwMGisPMVre8ZkkuUfbQntjw/viewform?pli=1) link.
