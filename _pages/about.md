Welcome to ZoÃ« Holmes' Quantum Information and Computing (QIC) group at EPFL. We work on all sorts to do with quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning with a focus largely (but not exclusively) on methods for near-term quantum computers.

### open positions

**Two Post Doc positions** are available in the QIC group at EPFL. 

Position 1: This position will be focused broadly on analysing the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry joint with Roche. 2 year position, immediate start possible but somewhat flexible.

Position 2: This position is joint with Christa Zoufal and Stefan Woerner at IBM Quantum with a focus broadly on error analysis and algorithm development for real and imaginary time quantum evolution. 3 year position, immediate start possible but flexible.

Rolling deadline

To **apply**, please follow [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScm6P163UChmDzkHN9kidxld_cwMGisPMVre8ZkkuUfbQntjw/viewform?pli=1) link.
